# Redirect

Imagine you have code in Python(endpoints) that you want to migrate to go. <br/>
So you keep exact the same contract, the endpoint is the same but you move than to Go. <br/>
Them in Python you do a redict, that way the client does not need to update the endpoint immediately, this is useful when you have a lot of clients and you want to give them time to update their code or in mobile apps that people dont update the app. <br/>
